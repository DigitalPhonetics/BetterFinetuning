# SpeechRepresentationFinetuning
Code accompanying our paper on finetuning self-supervised general speech representations with a combination of contrastive and non-contrastive methods.

This is currently a placeholder until the code is cleaned up and ready.

We are aiming to have the full code here in the next few days.
